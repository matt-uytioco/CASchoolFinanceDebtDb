In the update_db file, run node app.js. Then, open the update_db.html file in your live server. Upload the csv file that was created using Wilson's aspect of the website. This adds new rows to the finance_data table of the database, which the various queries I have created in the database.js file and app.js express server can call. Furthermore, if you include  '/export-finance-data' at the end of the local host link, the csv you have just uploaded will update the data visualization aspect of the website.
